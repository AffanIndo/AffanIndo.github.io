Today I just installed TES Oblivion from GOG and there is 1 problem if I play it on Wine, it crashes during startup. When I check WineDB, turned out it is a common problem and I just need to disable **winegstreamer** to fix it. But I searched whole internet and found no step by step tutorial how to do it, so... enjoy!
