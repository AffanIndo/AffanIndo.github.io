Hello guys, This night's post is not about programming. Today I wanna write about Dark Souls. Dark Souls is like typical hack-and-slash RPG but it is terribly difficult. After finished the game several times, I attempted to play it again but without leveling up!

The point is my level will stay at lvl 1 till the end. This post's purpose is to documenting my run, so if I came into trouble in the future, I can seek this post to refresh my memory, so here we go!

Classes starts at different level, but the only class start with level 1 is **Pyromancer**. Be sure to pick that. Pyromancer starts off with clothes, pyro glove and axe. The pyro glove didn't scale based on stats, so it is good for SL 1, and the axe isn't too terrible so it is a solid starting gear for pyromancer. BTW I picked **Master Key** so I can skipped most part of the game.

Note that this order is based on my experience.

1. Asylum Demon  
    Tutorial's boss, easy AF. Skip from him the first time then attack from above on second encounter. FYI you can *hit him twice* when attacking from above, because he has two hit counter. First jump attack by `R2 + Up`, then after the jump attack succesful, immediately do plunge attack by pressing `R1` mid-air. Be sure to do this in quick succession, after you do both of that attack, his HP is halfed by now. Just go around him and attack his butt, dodge when necessary.

2. Taurus Demon  
    After I arrived in Firelink Shrine I immediately going to undead burg, then go to the shop to get **Reinforced Club**. It is the best weapon for SL 1 run. It has high damage, and decent bleed effect. I am planning to have 3 Reinforced Club LOL. Fire one, Lightning one and Divine one, on this post I will not talk when I upgrade the weapon. I always upgrade it when I have the material. I skipped this boss by using Master Key.

3. Bell Gargoyles  
    By skipping the Taurus Demon using Master Key, I arrived at undead church immediately. Then I freed Lautrec then summon Solaire to help me fight this boss. Bell Gargoyles is easy with Solaire's help. Just hack away while he attack Solaire. After several solid hit, you can pay attention to his partner. But his partner only has half health, so I just hack away (again). After this, I went to Firelink Shrine then proceed to kill Lautrec to get **Ring of FaP**. There is an easy way to kill him. It is to kick him off the edge then exit then load the game again. His ring will be on the ground.

4. Pinwheel  
    While I still in Firelink Shrine. I think it is nice to get **Rite of Kindling** too. So I headed to the Catacomb. There is shortcut by jumping down several times, so I will not overwhelmed by the enemy. After using the shortcut, I arrived at Leeroy's sign then I summon him.

    I actually get trouble with Pinwheel, his *Kamehameha* attack always OHKO'd me. So in the end I let Leeroy to spam his attack on Pinwheel meanwhile I killing the fakes. When I found the real pinwheel, I hacked him till the death. Yeay, I got **Rite of Kindling** and **Mask of the Mother**. At first I wanted to get Mask of the Father, But after a while using Mask of the Mother, I REALLY LOVE IT! It has HP Boost! Definitely good for SL 1 run and Ring of FaP Enhance it more.

5. Sif, the Great Grey Wolf  
    Yes. I beat Sif early. Because I was playing on the forest then I decided to visit the doggo. Sif's fight isn't terribly difficult. You don't need shield on this fight unless you suck at rolling. But rolling is preferred. Everytime after Sif doing his attack, he leave a huge opening then slashing before retreat. That is Sif's main moveset. So when he doing his first attack, roll to the front so you landed on Sif's belly, then proceed to slash his leg. Then you don't have to worry about his retreat attack, because you stand below his belly, you will not get hit by it. Then repeat this process until he is dead (RIP Sif :'( I don't like killing him after I defeated DLC on previous play through).

6. Moonlight Butterfly  
    Still on the forest. Just summon Beatrice then let her do her things :)

7. Capra Demon  
    I realized that I need that person whom can upgrade my pyro glove. He is trapped in the sewer. So I had to beat Taurus Demon to get **Key to the Sewer**. Beating Taurus Demon is easy, but his dog's just annoying AF, so I just use fireball trick to kill him from outside, easy win :)

8. Gaping Dragon  
    I skipped this boss tho...  
    I went to the Sewer just to get **Large Ember** and rescue the pyro man.

9. Chaos Witch Quelaag  
    So far this is my favorite boss fight. Since my best weapon is Fire Reinforced Club, but she is immune to fire too so my pyro glove is useless. I had to rely on my +7 Axe. I summon the head sack girl to help me distract Queelag. On this battle I must be careful about her lava spit and her explosion. When she is about to spit lava, I move to the side then hacked her spider legs, on my first try, I imprisoned inside her leg, so be careful when hacking away her leg, don't get too close. Don't attack her back side, her fire fart can OHKO you. For the sword attack just roll to the side. FOr the explosion you must roll away quickly, if you rolled late, it is better to shield up rather than died mid-roll. My adrenaline rush is pumped on this battle, it feels so wonderful! 

10. Iron Golem  
    Summon Tarkus then let him do his things :)

    At this point, before reaching Anor Londo my goal weapon is **+5 Fire Reinforced Club**, **+10 Hand Axe** (Starting axe, I want to turn this in to lightning when I reach Anor Londo), and upgrading **Pyro Glove** until +15 (Actually I get it into ascended +5 because I meet Queelana on Blighttown)

11. Dragon Slayer Ornstein & Executioner Smough  
    A.K.A. Super Londo Bros. I wrote this post right after I killed him both. I always hated this battle because I always had a bad memory when fighting them. 100% of my play through is pure luck when it comes to these guys. On this play through it is so easy! Just imagine SL 1 can finished Super Londo Bros in 2 attempt when my good character need 10+ times to beat this f*ckers.

    The first thing I did when I come inside this room is to take a cover to the first right pillar. Smough will use his running drive hammer meanwhile Ornstein will jump landing beside of me, then I use Pyromancy several times, Then I repeat this process using the first left pillar, then Ornstein dead. That was easy!

    Then it is time to fight giant Smough. Giant Smough is easy, fight him near a pillar, every time he did an attack, just hid behind the pillar, but when he jump to do the butt flop, roll back two times. Repeat this process until he dead :)

12. Ceaseless Discharge  
    After I got Lordvessel, then it is the time for the big bosses. I decided to go to Bed of Chaos first because I want to get Fire Tempest early.

    Grab the robe then ran away, he will fall off ;) easy

13. Centipede Demon  
    I died a lot on here because of the lava, once I get the ring midfight, I can fight him easily. Also thanks to the Sunbro for the help :)

14. Demon Firesage  
    I die a few times when fighting him. But once I found out that he doesn't have any fire resistant, my pyromancies burn him :)

15. The Bed Of Chaos  
    The point is kill the thing on the right and the left then kill the bug in the middle, easy. But the problem there are many obstacles along the way. There is a trick to quit the game and opening it again so you start on the middle again. This one's tricky :)

16. Seath the Scaleless  
    Fire tempest killed him in like... 2 hits. When he is going to do his first attack, immediately run around him so his attack reached his own crystal. Finished him off when he is staggered because of that.

17. Stray Demon  
    I have a trouble fighting with him several times in the past, so here we go again. Actually I came here again because I am afraid of Nito. I'm not good with skeleton and stuff :/

    WHen you fell into the pit, go roll back two times then the roll the third time according to his attack. You'll be on his back and avoiding his attack. After this, Stay behind his back then wack him. Be wary of the AoE attack, roll away 2 times or roll to his left side.

18. Nito  
    The problem about Nito is his skeletons, it is so annoying. So prepare a divine weapon then attack his 3 skeletons right away. After this, you'll have interruptable fight with Nito. Except if you aggro the large skeleton on the very back. Stay away from that. My fire tempest only hit him once, dealing half of his HP. I killed the rest of him using my mad skillz. Thus Nito is dead (again).

19. Crossbreed Priscilla  
    I am ashamed for doing this ;-; I use great combustion on her tail for immediate tail weapon. Then using great fireball to finish her. Fells bad man, I wasted that fluffy tail.

20. Gwyn Lord of Cinder  
    Summon the sunbros then while Gwyn is distracted, use lots of pyromancy on him. Easy.
