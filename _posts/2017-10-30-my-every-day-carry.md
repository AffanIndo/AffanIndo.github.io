I really like seeing other people's EDC. It shows how their life going and what they do every day. I am a highschool student, I am a comic book artist, and someday I want to become graphic designer and programmer. This is my EDC:

* **Glasses** - Can't live without one.
* **Wallet** - I own one but I still don't know how to properly use it, though. Usually I just dump my money into my bag because stuffing my money into wallet took time.
* **Samsung Galaxy Note** - I am an artist, and fortunately I have a Samsung tablet that has stylus, I love drawing in this device. The stylus is great, it is created with Wacom technology. If you don't know what Wacom is, it is a company that create drawing tablet for artists. Good job, Samsung.
* **Sony Vaio** - My lovely laptop, I use Ubuntu 16.04 for the OS, I use this mainly for programming purposes, I usually draw in my Windows PC.
* **Power Bank** - My Samsung's battery life is very short nowadays because it is old already. Always got 'em every time I need to bring my Samsung.
* **Blank Notepad** - I prefer blank rather than lined because I am a visual thinker, when I jot down notes, I need to draw graphic, mindmap and stuff like that. This way, the line is useless because I write the way I want.

Now to my drawing stuff:
* **1x Mechanical Pencil** - They are neat because I don't have to sharpen them everytime, and I work a lot with pencil, I got stressed when I have to sharpen my stuff every day.
* **2x Gel Pen** - I prefer gel pen because they are so smooth to write with. I have a bad luck with normal pen, usually when I buy one, they are always jammed or something. I have 2 because they got used up reaally quick.
* **1x Drawing Pen 0.3** - For drawing a reaaally thick stuff.
* **2x Drawing Pen 0.1** - I got 2 of them because I use them the most.
* **1x Drawing Pen 0.05** - For drawing detailed stuff.
* **1x Normal Pen**
* **1x Eraser**
* **1x Pencil Sharpener**
* **4x Pencil 2B** - I told you I work with pencil the most haha.
* **1x Pencil 8B** - For finishing drawing I use this to make some part reaally dark
* **1x Iron Ruler 15 c**m - They are small and sturdy. Small ruler is the way to go because I can move them easily.
* **1x Pencil Case** - Normal pencil case But it has many pockets, though. This way I can divide my drawing equipments.
