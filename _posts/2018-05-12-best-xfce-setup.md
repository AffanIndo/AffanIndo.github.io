*"Another setup? eugh"*

I know what you are thinking, but hear me out.

On the past, I got *into* XFCE because I love the "defaults". I love the white-ness of it, I love the looks of it, I love everything. Just look at this beauty

I've changed my XFCE looks several times and I never *satisfied* with anything. But recently my last setup gave me the "defaults" vibe and I **will** make this setup my "defaults" setup from now.

You might think that this current setup is boring or whatnot, but I **strive** to get this "defaults" vibe in it. I want to make a rice that is *not that eye pleasing* but leaning towards the *usability* side. And this is the result that I got. Here's the usual setup:

* **OS:** Ubuntu 16.04
* **DE:** XFCE
* **GTK:** Flatabulous
* **Window Theme**: Vertex-Dark
* **Vim Color Scheme:** Hybrid
* **Terminal Color Scheme:** Hybrid
* **Terminal:** URxvt
* **Icons:** Ultra-Flat
* **Font:** Fira Mono

I am not saying that I will not make more *ricing* post but this is my *blank state* rice. I hope you find this post helpful, see you on the next post :)

**Update (2019-01-09):** And in this post I will list every "tweaks" that I add to my XFCE desktop.
