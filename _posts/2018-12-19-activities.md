I'm in Bandung, Indonesia, trying to have a productive organized life while studying CS at university. This is what I spend my time doing:

* Being a good friend, and son
* Studying computer science at university
* Writing tech-related blog
* Learning Python
* Learning C++
* Learning Web Development
* Event Organizer at Nihon no Matsuri
* Comic book artist at Balon Kata
* Creating art videos on Youtube
* Illustrator at Deviantart, and Pixiv
* Learning Japanese

**These are my main priorities right now.**

I am open to new opportunities. However, I will stick to my priorities 90% of the time. As a result, I will say no to the majority of requests that come my way now.

If my activities or priorities happen to change, Iâ€™ll update this page to reflect those changes. Last update was December 19, 2018.
