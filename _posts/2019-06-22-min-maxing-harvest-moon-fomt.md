Min-Maxing everything is bad, it sucks the fun from the game. I can't even enjoy Harvest Moon FOMT anymore. So, consider that as a warning, but if you want to min-max it, be my guest. Let's start your farm by min-maxing everything in first Spring!

* Your target is 18th Spring Horse Race, we need a basket (5000G), a bag upgrade (3000G), and some seed money.
* Our first source of income is Harvest Goddess TV Game. Turn on the tv, press left several times until it appeared. The game will come up, win 10-14 times to get an item that you could sell for 1000G. You could do it 5 times a day until 5th Spring. Since you start at 2nd Spring, you could get 20,000G. Buy a basket ASAP!
* After this morning ritual, do your crops. Clean the field, buy some seeds, water the crops, sell the crops. This is your second income.
* Third income, foraging! Sell honey, colored grass, bamboo shots, anything you can find. Don't forget to grab some flowers for girls you like and Harvest Goddess.
* Last income, mine the hell out of it. First few days you just have 3 slots, mine deep and grab those Mystrile/Orichalcum. After you get a basket, just dump anything from Copper to Orichalcum there.
* 4th Spring is Bold's birthday, give him lots of flour so he'll help you with your work. Don't forget to occasionally give the others some colored grass according to their colors. I recommend having a birthday guide to know everyone's birthday date.
* Upgrade your tools. I prioritize the watering can. Time doesn't pass inside a room. So, everyday after mining use the hot spring and do some rounds of watering the floor. Your target is gold watering can, so you could water 3x3 tile.
* On 18th Spring, bet on a horse and win! Hopefully you got a basket, a bag upgrade, and some money. Trade medals with Broaches, Sell 'em for 2000G each, easy money.
* At this point, the Harvest goddess likes you, your favorite girl have purple heart, lots of sprites to help you, golden watering can, basket, bag upgrade, and tons of money. You're free to do what you want!
