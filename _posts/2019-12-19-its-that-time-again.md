It's that time again, I'm using my blog to lay down my thoughts and clearing my head. So there will be no useful information here, folks. Just some of my random musings.

Right now I'm watching a DistroTube video about Doom Emacs. It kinda resonates in me because I used it on the past, but I dropped it. I'm thinking about picking it up back again. But meh, I already use VSCodeVim, I think that's good enough. After that, I just think, "Hmmm.. what else would I try during this holiday". Because I know, if I don't plan this holiday, it's just gonna ended up me lazying around doing nothing and just stresses myself. So, here I am rambling about what I'm going to do during my holiday, on this blog page. While writing this, I have tons of tabs opened about holiday ideas haha, too bad ideas on pinterest is for women, so you'd get manicure pedicure, baking cookies, writing cute journal and stuff. Probably because not a lot of male searching this. I might want to check Reddit or something to get what the community says or something.

* **Clean the house** - I might do this tomorrow morning tho, my room is dusty af, can't really stand it anymore.
* **Read a book** - Been stuck with The Collected by Joe Abercrombie. I'll finish it ASAP and move on to other books. I have reading list on navbar, so you might see it updated more often.
* **Play a video game** - By writing this article, I haven't created it, but I'll make a gaming backlog to keep track on the game I'm playing.
* **Learn japanese** - The article suggest to learn a new language. I've been learning Japanese since high school, so might learn it more seriously during the break.
* **Draw** - Gonna fill my sketchbook, I'll go to art supply store first to stock up supplies, also gonna buy some interesting drawing equipment like G-Pen or watercolor.
* **Take an online course** - I have SkillShare account, also there are tons of good course on YouTube. So I'm going to learn a lot from online.
* **Watch movies** - A list wouldn't be complete without this. Maybe I'll go to a nice cinema when Ip Man 4 come out.
* **Run** - I've been running 3 times a week this few months. I'll maintain it during this holiday. Not only that, I need to improve my physique by doing athletic goal like X amount of push-up and pull-up or stuff like that.
* **Cook** - I always go to sunday market and ended up never buying anything. But on this break I'll learn to cook or something. Also sometimes I use "it's not sunday yet" as an excuse for not cooking. I'll also try to buy ingredients on normal day haha. Sure, doing grocery on morning market is interesting, but I don't need to buy it at that market every time.
* **Exploring the city** - There is a tip about pretending I'm not from this city and go to must-see places around the town. So yeah! definitely gonna do that.
* **Develop healthy habits** - “Habit is either the best of servants or the worst of masters.”
* **Become a content creator** - I have a growing YouTube art channel that hasn't developed recently since I don't draw that often anymore. I'll try to focus on these kinda things during holiday.
* **Enjoy!** - The most important thing is to enjoy it! Don't get stressed out just because I have nothing to do, it's called a break goddamnit! Also this guide is just a quick writeup dude, not mean to be a gospel that I absolutely have to follow. So, enjoy your holiday!
