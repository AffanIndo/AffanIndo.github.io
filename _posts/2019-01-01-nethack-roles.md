This guide will point out things that players should keep in mind about early-game with some roles. This guide will only explain about early-game and suggestions to do during those time, also this guide will not extends beyond Sokoban.

## Valkyrie

* You got cold resistance at level 1, stealth at level 1, and speed at level 7.
* Reach Expert in long sword and dagger. Don't bother with spells.
* Read 1 low-leveled spellbook. this way, you can forget it 20.000 turns later.
* If playing Lawful Dwarven Valkyrie, go to Minetown early for the shops and (hopefully) magic lamp.
* Accumulate stack of daggers from Dwarves in Gnomish Mines. Use your pet if they're peaceful.
* Get Excalibur when you're at least level 5. Preferably level 7 for speed intrinsics.
* If you can find silver saber, train it to Basic.  You can find one on Minetown watch captain.
* You can reach Skilled in two weapon combat, but some people prefer having shields over twoweaponing.
* After Minetown, go for Sokoban. Mines' end is not that necessary because Valkyrie quest artifact acts as a luckstone.

## Rogue

* You got stealth at level 1, and searching at level 10.
* Orcs are slightly easier early-game due to their starting food, poison resistance, infravision, cannibalism, and same-race sacrifice.
* Drop your starting short sword immediately because you'll never use it.
* Your main weapon is thrown daggers, your main objective is to train it to Expert.
* Do an early Sokoban to train your strength.
* Untrap dart traps, and dip it in your starting potion of sickness.
* If you want to, reach Expert in crossbows, but don't advance this skill beyond Basic until you have mastered daggers.
* If you can find silver saber, train it to Skilled.  You can find one on Minetown watch captain.
* You can reach Expert in two weapon combat. But, some people prefer not to because single-handed Grayswandir does a lot of damage already.
* If you want to train spells, you can reach Skilled in divination, escape, and matter.
