This guide will point out things that players should keep in mind about early-game with some roles. This guide will only explain about early-game and suggestions to do during those time, also this guide will not extends beyond Sokoban.

## Valkyrie

* Reach Expert in long sword and dagger. Don't bother with spells.
* Read 1 low-leveled spellbook. this way, you can forget it 20.000 turns later.
* If playing Lawful Dwarven Valkyrie, go to Minetown early for the shops and (hopefully) magic lamp.
* Accumulate stack of daggers from Dwarves in Gnomish Mines. Use your pet if they're peaceful.
* Get Excalibur when you're at least level 5. Preferably level 7 for speed intrinsics.
* If you can find silver saber, train it to Basic.  You can find one on Minetown watch captain.
* You can reach Skilled in two weapon combat, but some people prefer having shields over twoweaponing.
* After Minetown, go for Sokoban. Mines' end is not that necessary because Valkyrie quest artifact acts as a luckstone.
