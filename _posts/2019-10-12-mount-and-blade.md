When I play this game, I'm so frustrated because literally there is no good stats guide out there for beginners. After several weeks, I finally understand it. But damn, why there are no good M&B guides out there? So, I made one myself because it wasn't fun not knowing how to properly set up your stats.

There are 3 kinds of stats: Attributes,  Skills, and Proficiencies. Attributes max out at 10 points, Skills at 30 points, and Proficiencies at 699 points.

Attributes and Skills related to each other. For every 3 points of Attributes you put in, you can increase 1 point of corresponding Skills. As you can see, I have 30 Strength and I'm able to put 10 Power Draw. Usually, people put it on multiples of 3: like 3, 6, 9, 12, up until 30. I have 30 Strength and 9 Agility, so I can have 10 points max for Strength Skills, and 3 point max for Agility Skills. Later on this game I bumped my Agility to 12 so I can have 4 point max for Agility Skills. I have 7 Intelligence and 7 Charisma because that's the default value, 6 Intelligence and 7 Intelligence is basically the same because you have to reach 9 Intelligence to add another point to Skills.

### Attributes

Over time, the exp needed to reach next level is insane, that's why you need to plan your Attributes and Skills beforehand. Usually, people pick 1 Attributes that they want to max, and build their character around it.

* For example, my build is Strength build, so I have 30 Strength, and only invest in other Attributes as needed, like only 9 or 12 Agility for Riding and Shooting from Horseback.

* As for another build, you can put 30 Agility for maximum Riding, then put several points to Strength for Ironflesh or Powerstrike (don't wanna have an agile warrior with spaghetti hands, aren't we?).

* Or maybe 30 Int for maximum Surgery and First Aid.

* Or, 30 Charisma for maximum Trade Skill.

As you can see, pick which Skills you want to max (for example, my character is an archer with maximum Power Draw. So, 30 Strength it is) then, max one of your Attribute based on your chosen Skills. Don't forget to raise some other Attributes to complement your chosen Attributes.

### Skills

Attributes are easy enough, there are only 4: Strength, Agility, Intelligence, and Charisma. How about Skill? There are tons of those, see the table [here](https://mountandblade.fandom.com/wiki/Skills).

There are Personal Skills (affect the character itself), Party Skills (affect the whole party), and Leader Skills (just for the main character). Generally, you only want to level up Leader and Personal Skills, since you can level up Party Skills on your companion instead to not waste any Skills on your main character. However, there are some Party Skills that you maybe want to level up by yourself, like Trainer (each character who has Trainer Skill adds up, so the more the better), Wound Treatment (bonus points if main character max it), and Surgery (bonus points if main character max it).

As for how much should you invest on the start? 3 is a good starting number. 3 Power Strike and 3 Riding is a good starting point for a warrior who uses horses. Later on you could choose if you want to max it to 10, or just bring it half way to 4 or 5.

### Proficiencies

Finally, Proficiencies is the easiest one to understand. Use a weapon and you raise Proficiencies. Don't think about it too much. For example, I use Bow a lot, that's why I have almost 300 points of Proficiencies in that weapon. Just use any of your favorite weapon.
