### Peraturan

Saya hanya akan menggunakan guide missable content dari [sini](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/3k2uz3/final_fantasy_missables/). Selain ini, saya bermain tanpa walkthrough.

* First off, by doing a sidequest after you get the airship you can class change into more powerful classes (this also allows you to learn better magic)
* There are 4 extra dungeons that are unlocked once you beat their respective elemental dungeon in the main story, these dungeons contain bosses from FF 3-6 and the best equipment in the game. Some of the bosses are (compared to the rest of the game) very hard though. There's also another extra dungeon but I don't know much about it since I never played the PSP version that introduced it.
* After obtaining the Magic Key you can go back to earlier areas and open up locked doors giving you better equipment
* Picking up the Adamantite in the final elemental dungeon will give you the most powerful sword in the original game. However, since the game has been remade multiple times, this is no longer the strongest sword. Still worth picking up though.
* Right before the boss of the final elemental dungeon you go over a big "bridge" of sorts, on this bridge there's a 1/64 chance you'll encounter the strongest enemy in the original game (he was pretty much a superboss in the original NES version) but since then he's been watered down.
