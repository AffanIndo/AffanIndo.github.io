header: XFCE, Light yet Beautiful

I use Unity for a damn long time. But it hogs so many resources. When I use i3 several weeks ago I just realized how much Unity ate my RAM. If you want something light like i3 but fully featured DE, you might consider XFCE. It is a desktop environment that aims to be light and beautiful at the same time. Here are my XFCE ricing of Ubuntu 16.04:
