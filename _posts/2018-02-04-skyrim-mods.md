Hello guys, maybe you know I played Skyrim a lot. I played it since I was in middle school. My mod list isn't increased, but it is more refined because I have a potato PC, so I can't just install everything. I had to hand-pick each of them to get the best out of the performance.

**THIS IS NOT TUTORIAL HOW TO INSTALL SKYRIM MODS, THIS IS JUST MY MOD LIST**

### DLC

A lot of mods depends on the DLC, so I got 3 of them (Hearthfire, Dawnguard, Dragonbon). Usually High-Res DLC isn't needed.

### Mod Organizer

This is my preferred mod organizer (yeah, that's the name. Mod Organizer), many people use NexusMods but I think MO is the best one. It separates the mod and your data folder so you don't have to make your Skyrim installment into a clusterfuck of mods. Place MO somewhere, and install the mods through MO, and if you launch Skyrim via MO, the mods will be activated, no need to `bEnable blahblahblah` anymore.

### SKSE

SKSE is a mod that makes other mod can do amazing stuff because default Skyrim is kind of limited, install SKSE because a lot of good mods need it. Mod Organizer can't install this one because SKSE has files outside the Skyrim data folder so you have to install everything manually.

### Essentials

* **Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch** - Bethesda has stopped Skyrim updates but there is someone who created a mod to fix all the leftover bugs. The version that require no DLC is outdated, so you need the legendary edition (or normal Skyrim with 3 DLC) to have the most updated bugfixes.
* **SkyUI** - I don't hate Skyrim default interface, to be honest. But this mod makes it easier for PC user because the default one is optimized for console. This mod aim to fix that. Also, SkyUI has menu to configure a lot of mods. Several mod require SkyUI. If you don't like the interface and only want the MCM menu, you can install SkyUI-Away.
* **The Choice is Yours** - Don't you hate when you accidentally heard people talking and then their conversation sparks up a quest? This mod make a lot of quests don't start automatically.
* **Alternate Start - Live Another Life** - I played new character a lot. That's why I want to skip the Helgen beginning. Also, this help with roleplaying :) If you want additional starting points, you can install **New Beginnings**, an extension of this mod.
* **Your Own Thoughts** - Make third person message appears as if they are from first person message. So *"You saved the game"* became *"I saved the game"*.
* **Ordinator** - Alter the perk points because I got bored by the default ones. Also, get the additional files **Ordinator - Thief Skills Rebalance** and **Ordinator - Perk points at Levels 50-75-100**.
* **Apocalypse** - Add several new spells. Also, get the **Apoalypse - Ordinator Compatibility Patch**.
* **Wildcat** - Add several improvements to battle. Also, increase character and enemy damage so battle didn't last longer.
* **Andromeda** - Standing Stones overhaul.
* **Auto Unequip Ammo** - Self-explanatory.
* **Auto Unequip Helmet** - Self-explanatory.
* **Immersive HUD** - Hide the HUD when you don't need it.
* **Run for Your Lives** - Civilian hide in their house when there is a dragon/vampire attack.
* **Rich Merchants** - Make merchant has 10K gold. I hate refreshing their inventory if I have a lot of stuff to sell. It makes the speech perk that let you increase merchant's gold useless, though.
* **Softer Conjuration Sounds** - The default conjuration sounds is too much for my ears. Fortunately, someone feels the same and decided to make a mod to fix it.

### Performance

Since I have potato PC, I Follow [this Youtube guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_SciRvDTVI) to improve performance. There are a lot of tweaks in that video, not only by installing these mods. So, refer to that video if you want to use these mods to their full potential.

* **Texture Optimizer - Pine Needle FX** - Performance boost.
* **Texture Optimizer - Rainfall FX** - Performance boost.
* **Texture Optimizer - Snowfall FX** - Performance boost.
* **Texture Optimizer - The Rift - Aspen Leafes FX** - Performance boost.
* **Bethesda Performance Textures - Animals and Creatures** - Boost performance by using custom texture.
* **Bethesda Performance Textures - Armors, Weapons, and Clothes** - Boost performance by using custom texture.
* **Skyrim Project Optimization** - Boost performance by unrender certain elements when you're not looking at them.

### Optional

* **Sacrosanct** - Vampire overhaul. I use this mod when I play as a vampire.
* **RV Vampire Eyes** - I use this mod when I play as a vampire.
* **Better Vampire Lord Transformation** - I use this mod when I play as a vampire.
* **Purity** - Kind of ENB for low PC. This mod not only alter the lightning, also the water and night texture too. Nice mod without big hit in performance.
* **Summermyst** - Add tons of enchantments.
* **Paper World Map** - I prefer this kind of map than Skyrim's Google Earth map. Put it at the very bottom of the load order.
* **Enhanced Camera** - My choice for first person camera. I heard this mod is the best one, so I use this. Haven't really tried the other, though.
* **Cutthroat Merchant** - Make merchants sells expensive and buy cheap. Preventing you from going rich. I feel comfortable using *Hard* and *Medium*. *Easy* isn't impactful enough even though. Just enable one of the esp of your pick.
* **Scarcity** - Make chests contain less loot. Put the **Scarcity - Less Loot Mod** in load order before the multiplier.
* **Harvest Overhaul** - I like it when I harvest some Deathbells, the game give me 3 Deathbells instead of 1, so I don't spend hours of grinding to get it. For me this is essential for alchemist character.
* **Glowing Ore Veins 300** - Make mining spot glowing. The default one is too dim and hard to spot.
* **3x More Ore with 1 Third of the Swings** - I think this is the name of the file, not the mod. Just search "ore" or something. I hate smithing, though. This makes it less painful because less grinding, yeay!
* **Increased Bounty Rewards** - Makes radiant quest more rewarding. I pick the **Lite** Version.
* **Faster Skill Leveling** - Self-explanatory. You need to manually add the perk for this mod to active and remove the perk if you want to change the exp gain..
* **Skill Config** - Cheating mod. You can set your skill level in here. But it's nice if you want to roleplay certain character without too much grinding.
* **Fuz Ro D'oh** - Use this if you use a mod that has silent voice (a dialogue with subtitle but has no voice).
* **Immersive Weapons** - Seamlessly add tons of weapon to Skyrim.
* **Guard Dialogue Overhaul** - Alters the Guard Dialogue.
* **Immersive World Encounters** - Add new events and world encounters.
* **Better MessageBox Controls** - Self-explanatory.
* **Not So Fast - Main Quest** - Add delay between Main Quest Events.
* **The Paarthurnax Dillema** - Now you don't need to kill Paarthurnax if you want to side with The Blades.
* **Barenziah Quest Markers** - Self-explanatory.


### Beautiful Character

* **Enhanced Character Edit** - Add more slider and options in `showracemenu`.
* **ShowRaceMenu PreCacheKiller** - Prevent `showracemenu` from crashing if you have mod that add a lot of hairstyles or similar.
* **Cherry's Eyes** - Add more eye colors. I prefer this than **Pretty Eyes** Since the latter prefer to make realistic meanwhile I like colorful eyes similar to that of cosplayer's.
* **Lind's Mer Eyes** - Add more eye colors for the elves. I haven't tried it though since I pick human race more than elves.
* **SG Female Eyebrows** - Add more eyebrows.
* **Face Light** - Make your character's face bright.
* **CBBE** - Body mod.
* **BodySlide** - Alter the appearance of CBBE.
* **Caliente's Vanilla Outfits for CBBE** - CBBE replacer for default vanilla clothes and armors.
* **Fair Skin** - Texture for face and body. I like this a lot and I **don't** use another mod for the face because the one include within Fair Skin is pretty already. On the past I used **Univision** but now I like Fair Skin more because it includes the body texture too.
* **SG Hair 268** - The most complete hair I've ever used. But it isn't available on Nexus site so you have to go hunt it.
* **KS Hairdos Renewal** - Even more hairstyles!
* **Combined Hairstyle Collection** - Add some hairstyles which is a combined version of several hairstyles. So, the hair is more fluffy.
* **VHH** - Walking animation.
* **Pretty Female Idles** - Self explanatory. Also, it doesn't need FNIS.
